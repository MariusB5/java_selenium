# java_selenium_tutorial

**DISCLAIMER:** I take no credit for writing this program, I just followed instructions/edited the code.

This Java Selenium program was created based on the IntelliJ for Test Automation Engineers tutorial from Test Automation Univeristy: https://testautomationu.applitools.com/intellij.

After this Java tutorial I decided to stick with Python for a while.
